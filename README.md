# RacingGame
This is a racing game (complemented by cocos2d-x 2.2.6) ported by a HTML5 game written in JavaScript.

It began on 11/04/2016 and it took me 3 weeks to understand the method that Jakes Gordon did in his code.
Of course, I had other jobs to do for the company where I worked.

Then I started to code with Cocos2d-x-2.2.6 engine.
The 1st version named "RacingGame_Straight_V1" took me about 5 days to complete. I was so happy When the car could run on the straight road.



I studied some Javascript and HTML during this period.
